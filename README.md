# Sketch Pad Project

Welcome to the Sketch Pad project! This is a fun and interactive project where you create a 16x16 grid of square divs on a webpage. 

*Live Code Demo: https://sidification.github.io/etch-sketch/*

## About The Project

The Sketch Pad project involves dynamically creating a grid of square divs using JavaScript. You can set up a "hover" effect to change the color of these divs as your mouse passes over them, creating a pixelated trail like a pen. Also, you can add a button that prompts the user to enter the number of squares per side for a new grid, replacing the existing one.

## Project Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: The grid of square divs is created dynamically using JavaScript, not manually in the HTML file.
- **Flexbox Layout**: The grid squares are displayed using flexbox layout, showcasing its powerful capabilities.
- **Hover Effect**: A hover effect is implemented so that the grid divs change color as the mouse hovers over them.
- **Interactive Button**: A button is added at the top of the screen which, when clicked, prompts the user to enter a number for creating a new grid.
- **Error Checking**: The project includes checks for common errors, such as ensuring the CSS stylesheet is linked and the JavaScript console is error-free.

## Building the Project

Here are the steps involved in creating this project:

1. **Grid Creation**: Set up a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript. Put your grid squares inside another "container" div.
2. **Flexbox Layout**: Make the divs appear as a grid using flexbox layout. Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!
3. **Debugging**: Check your CSS stylesheet link and browser's developer tools if the grid is not being created. Add console.log statements in your JavaScript to ensure it's being loaded.
4. **Hover Effect**: Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.
5. **Interactive Button**: Add a button to the top of the screen that will prompt the user for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Remove the existing grid and generate a new one in its place.
